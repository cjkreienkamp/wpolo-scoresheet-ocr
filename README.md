# wpolo-scoresheet-ocr
Takes as input a scoresheet from a water polo game and outputs a file that lists the information in a tabular digital format. Uses optical character recognition (OCR) and OpenCV to read in the data.

### Abstract

Every major event of a water polo game, including goals, exclusions, penalties, and timeouts, are recorded by the table onto a scoresheet. For this data to be shared digitally, the coach or another league representative must do the tedious task of manually copying every mark on the scoresheet. It would save time if this upload could be done automatically using computer vision with an optical character recognition (OCR) system that could take a photo of the scoresheet as input and output digitized tables of the data. (will update after methods are carried out and results are obtained)



### Introduction

During a water polo game, there is a set of people, designated as the table, that manages the clock, updates the scoreboard with scores and penalties, keeps an official scoresheet, and carries out a few other administrative tasks. The scoresheet is the official record of the game. It includes information about the time and location of the game, the rosters for both teams, and a running record of the time of every major event, including the timestamp and player/team involved for every goal, exclusion, penalty, and timeout. An example can be seen below.

At the end of the game, both coaches and the referees must sign the scoresheet to validate its accuracy, and this scoresheet will be transferred to the governing league. When possible, a copy will be given to either coach. Often, especially in leagues with less funding, these scoresheets will be forgotten. In more official leagues, someone will manually type in the data from this sheet so that the league can publish the statistics for every player. The manual input of data is time consuming and tedious, and if done by a coach, takes away time that the coach could be using to analyze previous matches or develop team strategy.

Therefore it would be beneficial to the sport if a computer vision system could be created so that a coach or league administrator could take a picture of a scoresheet with an smartphone, and the system could automatically read in the data, organize it, and post it to a website to be available to everyone in the league.
