# wpolo-scoresheet-ocr
Takes as input a scoresheet from a water polo game and outputs a file that lists the information in a tabular digital format. Uses optical character recognition (OCR) and OpenCV to read in the data.

## Introduction
During a water polo game, there is a set of people, designated as the table, that manages the clock, updates the scoreboard with scores and penalties, keeps an official scoresheet, and carries out a few other administrative tasks. The scoresheet is the official record of the game. It includes information about the time and location of the game, the rosters for both teams, and a running record of the time of every major event, including the timestamp and player/team involved for every goal, exclusion, penalty, and timeout. At the end of the game, both coaches and the referees must sign the scoresheet to validate its accuracy, and this scoresheet will be transferred to the governing league. When possible, a copy will be given to either coach. Often, especially in leagues with less funding, these scoresheets will be forgotten. In more official leagues, someone will manually type in the data from this sheet so that the league can publish the statistics for every player. The manual input of data is time consuming and tedious, and if done by a coach, takes away time that the coach could be using to analyze previous matches or develop team strategy.

Therefore it would be beneficial to the sport if a computer vision system could be created so that a coach or league administrator could take a picture of a scoresheet with an smartphone, and the system could automatically read in the data, organize it, and post it to a website to be available to everyone in the league.

## Literature Review
An analysis of what has already been published about your chosen topic. Should be able to show how your research question fits into the context of your field.

## Methods:

A description of everything you did in your experiment or project, step-by-step. Needs to be detailed enough so that any reader would be able to repeat each step exactly on their own.

## Results:

What actually happened during your project or what you found at the end of your experiment. This is usually the best part to include the majority of your graphs, photos, tables, and other visual aids, as long as they help explain the results of your work.

Discussion:

An analysis of the results that integrates what you found into the wider body of research in your field. Can also include future hypotheses to be tested or future projects to build from your own.

Conclusion:

Can be included in the discussion if necessary. A final summary of the paper, including whether or not you were able to answer your original research question.

References and Appendices:

The reference page(s) is a list of all the sources you used to research and create your project/experiment, including everything cited in the literature review and methods sections. Remember to use the same citation style throughout the paper. An appendix would include any additional information about your work that you were not able to include within the body of your paper (like large datasets and figures) that would help readers better understand your results.
